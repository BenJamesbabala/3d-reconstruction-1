function [ x2, y2 ] = epipolarCorrespondence( im1, im2, F, x1, y1 )
% epipolarCorrespondence:
%       im1 - Image 1
%       im2 - Image 2
%       F - Fundamental Matrix between im1 and im2
%       x1 - x coord in image 1
%       y1 - y coord in image 1

% Q2.6 - Todo:
%           Implement a method to compute (x2,y2) given (x1,y1)
%           Use F to only scan along the epipolar line
%           Experiment with different window sizes or weighting schemes
%           Save F, pts1, and pts2 used to generate view to q2_6.mat
%
%           Explain your methods and optimization in your writeup
